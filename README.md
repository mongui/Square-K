# Square-K

**Square·K** is a small game of a marble moving through a maze moved by gravity based on a PC game I played in the 90's and whose name I don't know. It's made with [Processing](https://processing.org/) which allowed me to program easily for both Android and Windows platforms. It also uses [Box2D](http://jbox2d.org/) library as physics engine.

This game is mostly finished but it needs more maps besides some bugfixes and improvements.


## Map editor

How to use the Map Editor:

- Load "map-base.json" which contains all the necessary tiles and sound files.
- Place your mouse pointer over the block you want to paint on the grid and, using the arrow keys and the space bar, start drawing the map.
- To rotate a tile, press the space bar.
- When you finish, save the map to a file using this syntax: "map< LEVEL >-< STAGE >.json" inside the "data" folder.

Other tricks you should know about this tool:

- Ctrl-Right -> Adds columns to the left of the grid.
- Ctrl-Down  -> Adds lines to the top of the grid.
- Ctrl-C     -> Removes unused columns and lines.

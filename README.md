# Square-K
SquareÂ·K is an small game of a marble moving through a maze moved by gravity. It's made with processing which allowed me to program easily for both Android and Windows platforms.

This game is not finished and needs more improvements and also needs more maps, but anyone is free to design their owns with the tool that comes with the game.
There are also well known bugs in the android version which I will be solving gradually.
